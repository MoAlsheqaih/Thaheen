# Thaheen
## Description
*Thaheen* is an interactive question-generation and gamified learning system to enhance university students' academic performance. The platform aims to solve a common problem that most students face: lack of practice questions in core courses. 
Additionally, it introduces a gamification aspect to the idea by adding events similar to Kahoot!, which could make studying a fun experience. This problem is worth solving as we face it every semester and have found, through a survey and personal interviews, 
that so do other students.
